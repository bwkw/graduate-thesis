abstract = "A 33 term modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state is presented for methane. The adjustable parameters in the equation of state have been estimated using recent experimental data and least squares techniques which include the thermodynamic equilibrium conditions for the co-existing liquid and vapour phases. Comparisons of the new equation of state and an older modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state to experimental data are given."
